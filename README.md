# Fraudulent_Claim_Detection [ Advanced ML-Case-Study_upGrad]
Welcome to this assignment titled ‘Fraudulent Claim Detection.’ 
Before understanding the business objective, please download the data set and the starter notebook for this assignment.
The data is stored as a CSV file and contains information such as customer-related details (age, occupation and hobbies), policy information (coverage limits and premiums), incident specifics (type, severity and location), claim details (amounts and types of damage), vehicle information (make, model and year) and whether the claim was reported as fraud. 

the expected tasks are as follows:
